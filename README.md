Title of the project:  Real Time Bus Tracker

Description of the project:  
This web app displays the transit stations for the Boston Green and Red Lines as well as current vehicles in route.  Clicking on the button above will move the vehicles using real time data from mbta via a JSON call.  Due to the amount of data, the application only pulls data for all vehicles that are currently active on the Red transit Line.

How to Run: 
There is only 3 main files for this project including styles.css, index.html and mapanimation.js.   There are also 3 images used that can be found in the images folder.   You can download these files and run index.html from your local machine or the project can be ran from github at https://pamelaarcher.github.io/bostontransit

Roadmap of future improvements: 
•	Pulldowns that include list of different transit lines that can choose from.  The stations and vehicles will show for these stations.
•	Additional work on the button that currently brings in the latest longitude and latitude.  You can also see if vehicles have been added or have gone out of service.
•	Popups that provide details about the stops including addresses and services available at the stations
•	Popups about the vehicles including the id, whether outbound or inbound and other available information
